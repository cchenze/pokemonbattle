# Pokémon Battle Data Visualization                                                                                                                                         

This is my final project of IST 256 - Application Programming for Information Systems (Spring 2021)

- A simple app for Pokémon base stats comparison (HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed) and Pokémon battle predictor using Python

- Implemented Leaflet, PokéAPI, and MapQuest APIs to process requests to databases to get Pokémon stats, location areas, and images for visualization
